A Villager is a player character with no abilities, but the Village also includes any role not on the same team of the Werewolves, like the Guard, the Seer, the Witch, and others. Giving the Villagers addition powers, like the Guard or the Masons, tilts the balance toward them. To balance against the Village add roles that hamper them like the Fool or the Hapless Victim.
